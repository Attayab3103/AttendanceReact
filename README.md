- **PIN-based login** for teachers and admin
- **Class management**: Create, delete, and manage classes and students
- **Attendance, test, and activity tracking** (all keyed by student ID)
- **No static JSON**: All data is live from Firebase
- **Mobile-friendly, modern UI** with Tailwind CSS
- **Ready for Vercel or Docker deployment**

## How It Works

### Admin Flow
- The admin logs in at `/admin` using a secure PIN (set in your Firebase or code).
- Admin can create new teacher accounts, edit teacher names and PINs, or delete teachers.
- All teacher data is stored in Firebase and updates in real time for all users.

### Teacher Flow
- Teachers log in at `/teacher` using their unique PIN (set by the admin).
- After login, teachers see a dashboard with their name and a list of their classes.
- Teachers can:
  - **Create new classes** (which are linked to their account in Firebase)
  - **Delete classes** (removes the class and unassigns all students)
  - **Select a class** to manage students, attendance, tests, and activities
  - **Enroll students** by name (auto-assigns roll numbers)
  - **Remove students** (unassigns from class and reindexes roll numbers)
  - **Mark attendance** for each student by date (present/absent)
  - **Add/edit/delete test records** (subject, date, marks, description)
  - **Add/edit/delete activity records** (subject, date, status, description)
- All actions update Firebase instantly and are reflected for parents and admins.

### Parent Flow
- Parents go to `/parent` to view their child's reports.
- The dashboard shows all teachers, each with their classes as tiles.
- Parents select the relevant teacher and then the class.
- They enter their child's roll number (as assigned by the teacher) to view:
  - **Attendance report** (summary and daily breakdown)
  - **Test report** (all test records for the student)
  - **Activity report** (all activities for the student)
- All data is live and always up to date from Firebase.

### Data Model
- **Teachers**: `{ id, name, pin, classes: [classId, ...] }`
- **Classes**: `{ id, name, teacherId, studentIds: [...] }`
- **Students**: `{ id, name, rollNo, classId }`
- **Attendance**: `{ [studentId]: { [date]: 'Present' | 'Absent' } }`
- **Tests**: `{ [studentId]: { [date]: { subject, marks, totalMarks, description } } }`
- **Activities**: `{ [studentId]: { [date]: { subject, status, description } } }`
